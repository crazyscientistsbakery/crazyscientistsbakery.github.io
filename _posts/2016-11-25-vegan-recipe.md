**In the spirit of National Baking Day today**, many kitchens will be abuzz with the wafting aromas of freshly baked breads, cookies and the like. Many of these delicious recipes call for ingredients such as butter, eggs, milk and cream, which are not part of vegan or plant-based diets. Here are five simple swaps to make any of your favorite baking recipes vegan-friendly.

**Flaxseeds**: These omega-3-rich seeds have the ability to replace eggs with their gelling properties when mixed with water. Combine 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed meal + 3 tablespoons water for each egg. Let sit for 15 minutes before adding to recipe.

**Coconut Oil**: A plant-based replacement for butter, coconut oil can be used to make creamy frostings in addition to moist cakes, muffins and brownies. Use an equal amount of coconut oil as you would butter.

**Avocado**: Similar to coconut oil, avocado can serve as a replacement for butter. For best results, use mashed avocado in chocolate-based recipes in equal amounts as you normally would with butter.

**Tofu**: When it comes to cheesecake and pies such as pumpkin and chocolate cream, tofu can serve as an undetectable alternative. While there is no direct conversion, most recipes call for the soft or silken varieties of tofu to replace evaporated milk or cream.

Soy/Almond Milk: An easy swap is to replace cow's milk with a non-dairy milk such as soy or almond milk. Be sure to purchase the unsweetened and unflavored varieties to avoid changing the flavor of the recipe. Use in equal amounts as you would with cow's milk.
